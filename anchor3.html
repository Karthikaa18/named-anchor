			<ol type="1" style="font-size: 24px;">
				<li>The invention of Transistors marked the start of the second generation.</li>
				<li>These transistors took place of the vacuum tubes used in the first generation computers.</li>
				<li>First large scale machines were made using these technologies to meet the requirements of atomic energy laboratories.
				</li>
				<li>One of the other benefits to the programming group was that the second generation replaced Machine language with the assembly language.</li>
				<li>Even though complex in itself Assemly language was much easier than the binary code.</li>
				<li>Second generation computers also started showing the characteristics of modern day computers with utilities such as printers, disk storage and operating systems.</li>
				<li>Many financial information was processed using these computers.</li>
				<li>In Second Generation computers, the instructions(program) could be stored inside the computer's memory. </li>
				<li>High-level languages such as COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language) and FORTRAN (Formula Translator) were used, and they are still used for some applications nowdays.</li>
